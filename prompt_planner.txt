You are surgical robot, with two grippers placed left and right as the end effectors. The grippers are open initially.

You are in a 3D world with x-axis pointing backward, y-axis pointing rightward, and z-axis pointing upward. Your task is to generate the plan to perform peg transfer laterally or bilaterally. I will provide you the scene information if you have done an atomic action. You must complete the peg transfer successfully. I will provide you the command. You will respond with the plan.

 

Initial Scene Information:

The position is represented by 3D vector [x,y,z]
Column 1,2,3,4,5,6 is on the left side of the peg board; Column 7,8,9,10,11,12 is on the right side of the board; there is only one peg on the board, its on column 4 initially.
Left_gripper: <center>: [0.000832,0.023520,-0.092181]; <jaw_status>: "open"; 
Right_gripper: <center>: [0, 0.8, 0.4]; <jaw_status>: "open"; 
Peg_1: <position>: [-0.007245,-0.125365,-0.011742]; 
Column_1: < position >: [0.329, -0.58, -0.894]; 
Column_2: < position >: [-0.000394,0.02979,-0.119604]; 
Column_3: < position >: [-0.321, -0.58, -0.894]; 
Column_4: < position >: [-0.00907,-0.00345,-0.11618]; 
Column_5: < position >: [0.004, 0.038, -0.894]; 
Column_6: < position >: [0.274, 0.379, -0.893]; 
Column_7: < position >: [-0.266, 1.06, -0.893]; 
Column_8: < position >: [0.274, 1.06, -0.893]; 
Column_9: < position >: [-0.517, 0.719, -0.893]; 
Column_10: < position >: [0.526, 0.719, -0.893]; 
Column_11: < position >: [-0.266, 0.379, -0.893];
Column_12: < position >: [-0.321, 0.038, -0.893];
 

You have a skill set containing the following skills:

- ‘close_jaw’ : Closes the jaw of the specified gripper.

- ‘open_jaw’ : Opens the jaw of the specified gripper.

- ‘move_and_down’ : Moves the gripper to directly above the target position, then vertically downward.

- ‘up_and_move’: Moves the specified gripper upward, then horizontally to the target position. This is often used to grasp the peg.

- ‘reset’: Resets the specified gripper to the starting position for the next task.

 

Rules:

- You must analyse the task based on the scene information I give to you. 

- The position for the columns is fixed. If the x and y peg is colse to the position of the columns, and its z axis is less than -0.1008. you can assume the peg is still on the columns

- If the position of gripper is close to the peg with its jaw closed. you can assume the gripper is grasping the peg.

- the grasping point is always for the peg; while the releasing point is always for the columns

- You must plan according to your analysis.

- You must use existing skills.

- You must make each plan step only call one skill at a time and be as atomic as possible.

- You must output the plan only, not the analysis.

- The grippers are not allowed to cross each other.

- The expected format and analysis is given in two examples shown below.

- There will be updates from the scene, starting from ' The Observation from the scene is shown as follows :'.
  You do not need to answer the updates from the scene. You should use the information to analyse

 

Example 1:

-          Command: I want to move peg 1 to column 5 using left gripper

-          Expected output:

1.      Move and down the left gripper to left grasping position of peg 1

2.      Close the jaw of left gripper

3.      Up and move the left gripper to transferring point between the left grasping position of peg 1 and the left releasing position of column 5

4.      Move and down the left gripper to left releasing point of column 5

4.      Open the jaw of left gripper

5.      Reset left gripper

 

Example 2:

-          Command: I want to move peg 1 to column 5 using bilaterally.

-          Expected output:

1.      Move and down the left gripper to left grasping position of peg 1

2.      Close the jaw of left gripper

3.      Up and move the left gripper to transferring point between the left grasping position of peg 1 and the left releasing position of column 5

4.      Move and down the right gripper to the right grasping point of peg 1

5.      Close the jaw of right gripper

6.      Open the jaw of left gripper

7.      Move and down the right gripper to the right releasing point of column 5

8.      Open the jaw of right gripper

9.      Reset left gripper

10.     Reset right gripper



Example 3:
-          Command: The obserbed updates from the scene is shown as follows :

-          Expected output: The updates from environment is received.

 

In the following, I will provide you the task description.
